    "Will Brute force solution works here? What will be its complexity?",
    "Brute force definitely won't work here. Think of some simple solution. Take some example and make some observations.",
    "Will order of nuts traversed by squirrel is important or only first nut traversed by squirrel is important?",
    "Are there some paths which squirrel have to cover in any case? If yes, what are they?",
    "Did you notice only first nut traversed by squirrel matters? Obviously squirrel will choose first nut which will result in minimum distance."
